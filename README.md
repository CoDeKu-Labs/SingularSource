## Overview

**SingularSource** is an open-source project dedicated to providing a single, authoritative version of key concepts and theories in the field of DevOps. Our mission is to create a comprehensive, reliable, and easy-to-navigate resource that helps beginners and intermediates find the best information quickly and efficiently.

## Why SingularSource?

In the vast and ever-evolving world of DevOps, finding accurate and concise information can be overwhelming. With thousands of articles, tutorials, and opinions available online, it can be challenging to determine **_where to start and what to follow_**. **SingularSource** aims to solve this problem by offering:

- **Curated Content:** Carefully selected and consolidated information from the most credible sources.
- **Community Collaboration:** Contributions from the community, reviewed by industry experts to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **Continuous Updates:** Regular reviews and updates to keep the content current with the latest industry trends and best practices.
- **User-Friendly Structure:** Intuitive organization with clear categories and a powerful search functionality.

## Key Features

- **Solves the Overwhelm of Learning:** Tackles the challenge of learning new concepts by providing a single, reliable source amidst the plethora of available content.
- **Guidance on** **_Where to Start and What to Follow_**: Helps users understand **_where to start and what to follow_**, making the learning journey more structured and less confusing.
- **No Redundancy:** Ensures that there are no duplicate concepts or conflicting explanations. For example:
  - **What is DevOps?** 
    - DevOps is removing obstacles/roadblocks that slow down the delivery process of software.
    - **We do not keep another concept for 'What is DevOps'.**
  - **How Microservices Communicate?**
    - Microservices communicate using lightweight protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, gRPC, or messaging queues.
    - **We do not keep another article for the same topic or concept.**
- **Handling Multiple Approaches:** If there are different ways or methods to achieve something, we document all approaches within the same concept, using a numbered format:
  - **Example:**
    - **How to Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster:**
      - **Method 1:** Using kubeadm.
      - **Method 2:** Using a managed Kubernetes service like GKE or EKS.
      - **Method 3:** Using kops.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** From CI/CD to Infrastructure as Code, we cover a wide range of DevOps concepts.
- **Expert-Reviewed Content:** Collaborations with industry experts to maintain high standards of quality and reliability.
- **Open Source:** Fully transparent and open to contributions from anyone.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing and deployment of content to ensure it's always up-to-date.
